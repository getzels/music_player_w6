# Overview

I built a simple music player using C++ to improve my understanding of real-world programming with audio, user input, and file handling. As a software engineer, I wanted to practice using external libraries, object-oriented programming, and working with actual sound files in a terminal-based program.

This software lets a user load a music file and then play, pause, stop, or load a new track. It uses the SFML audio library to handle `.wav` or `.ogg` playback. I learned how to set up a CMake project, link libraries, and use classes to organize my code. I also had to solve some runtime and path errors, which taught me how to debug better in C++.
